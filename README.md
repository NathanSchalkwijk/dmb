Simple music bot for discord.

Feel free to use this as a base for coding your own music bot.


Requirements:
pip install asyncio
discord.py
python-dotenv
yt_dlp
PyNaCl


You need to create a file named .env in the same folder as app.py, this file needs to contain the following: BOT_TOKEN='your_bot_token'

To run the bot use "python3 app.py"


If you don't have a way to host the bot you can ask me to host it for you.

my discord is: @quillieofc


If you don't know how to get a bot token you can use this guide from writebots: https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/
