Simple music bot for discord, comes with pterodactyl egg for easy setup.

Feel free to use this as a base for coding your own music bot.


Requirements:
pip install asyncio
discord.py
dotenv
yt_dlp
PyNaCl


When installing normally without pterodactyl you need to create a file named .env in the same folder as app.py, this file needs to contain the following: BOT_TOKEN: "your_bot_token"



If you don't have a way to host the bot you can ask me to host it for you.
